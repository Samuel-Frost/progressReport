abstract = {Structure-and energy-related properties of defects formed on relaxed diamond surfaces were investigated. Simulation calculations were carried out for vacancies created on (111) and on (2×1) dimerized (100) index planes of diamond. Two different model functions (based on two-and three-body interactions) developed recently for carbon were employed in the calculations. Both functions produced comparable results. Top layer vacancies are more likely to form on the (100) surface than on the (111) surface. Calculations indicate that the diffusion of a single vacancy from the top surface layer to the second layer is not energetically favored.}

abstract = {Some of the assumptions underlying the molecular approach to the determination of the electronic properties of the vacancy in diamond have been examined. The ordering of the lowest electronic levels of the neutral and single negatively charged states of the vacancy is sensitive to the choice of atomic functions to represent the 2s and 2p orbitals on the atoms nearest the defect as well as to the symmetric relaxation of these atoms. However, for limited delocalisation of electronic charge from the vacancy there is no change in the ordering of the lowest levels. The 3T1 electronic state is predicted as the ground state of the neutral vacancy if the atoms nearest the defect relax towards its centre as implied by the molecular model; however, for a symmetric relaxation of the nearest neigh-bours away from the centre of the vacancy the 1E level is more likely to be the lowest level. Present experimental knowledge of the vacancy in diamond does not resolve this uncertainty.}

journal = {Journal of Physics: Condensed Matter},
abstract = {Diamond has many extreme physical properties and it can be used in a wide range of applications. In particular it is a highly effective particle detection material, where radiation damage is an important consideration. The WAR9 and WAR10 are electron paramagnetic resonance centres seen in irradiated, nitrogen-containing diamond. These S = 1/2 defects have C2v and C1h symmetry, respectively, and the experimental spectra have been interpreted as arising from nitrogen split-interstitial centres. Based upon the experimental and theoretical understanding of interstitial nitrogen defect structures, the AIMPRO density functional code has been used to assess the assignments for the structures of WAR9 and WAR10. Although the calculated hyperfine interaction tensors are consistent with the measured values for WAR9, the thermal stability renders the assignment problematic. The model for the WAR10 centre yields principal directions of the hyperfine tensor at variance with observation. Alternative models for both centres are discussed in this paper, but no convincing structures have been found.}

        abstract = {The results from EPR studies of CVD diamond which was intentionally silicon doped with isotopes in natural abundance or isotopically enriched are reported.  The observation of hyperfine satellites arising due to the presence of 29Si has provided definitive evidence for the involvement of silicon in two EPR centres in diamond which were previously suspected to involve silicon: KUL1 and KUL3.  KUL1 is unambiguously identified as the neutral silicon split vacancy defect (V-Si-V)0, whilst KUL3 is shown to be (V-Si-V)0 decorated with a hydrogen atom.  Data have also revealed that (V-Si-V)0 is preferentially oriented in samples grown on \{110\} substrates.

The negative nitrogen-vacancy centre (NV?) has been investigated.  Published parameters for the nitrogen hyperfine interaction produce an unsatisfactory fit to the experimental spectra and hence these parameters are redetermined.  Optically-excited EPR has been used to estimate the degree of spin polarisation of the NV-ground state and the increase in signal intensity with illumination has permitted the interaction between the unpaired electron and neighbouring 13C atoms to be studied.  Two sets of 13C hyperfine satellites have been identified, which account for {\texttt{\char126}}100\% of the unpaired electron probability density.

Despite the predictions that the neutral charge state of NV should have an S = ? ground state, this charge state has not previously been detected by EPR.  Optically excited EPR measurements reveal a trigonal nitrogen containing defect in diamond with an excited state populated via optical excitation.  Analysis of the spin-Hamiltonian parameters and the wavelength dependence of the optical excitation leads to assignment of this state to the 4A2 excited state of NV0.}

abstract = {A large number of complex defects are seen in natural and synthetic diamonds, but it is not known whether they form during growth or as a result of later processes. An understanding of diffusion profiles of the dopant impurities is crucial for design of electronic devices. We present here theoretical work on migration processes for several complexes including N, H and vacancies in diamond, to find out how they form. First-principles density functional calculations have been performed to study structural properties and the activation energies for migration of these defects. Migration paths were derived by constructing a set of several intermediate structures between two energy minima by linear interpolation. The effect of temperature on calculated barriers is described by including vibrational energy and entropy. It was found that the energy barrier for migration of interstitial hydrogen between two bond-centred positions is 2.8 eV. Also, hydrogen is readily trapped by both vacancies and by the N–V complex. Energies liberated in these reactions are 5.5 eV and 5.8 eV respectively.}
