abstract = {This review discusses atomistic modeling techniques used to simulate radiation damage in crystalline materials. Radiation damage due to energetic particles results in the formation of defects. The subsequent evolution of these defects over multiple length and time scales requiring numerous simulations techniques to model the gamut of behaviors. This work focuses attention on current and new methodologies at the atomistic scale regarding the mechanisms of defect formation at the primary damage state.}
