abstract = {Abstract In this paper we will consider some of the methods involved in carrying out density functional calculations within the framework of localised basis sets, specifically those of Gaussian type orbitals. Particular emphasis is placed on the methods used in the AIMPRO (Ab Initio Modelling PROgram) code, but mention is made of a number of developments and strategies used in other programs.},
